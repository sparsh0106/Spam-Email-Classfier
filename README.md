# Spam Email Classifier

This project demonstrates a **Spam Email Classifier** built using a machine learning approach. The notebook preprocesses email text data and trains a model to classify emails as spam or non-spam (ham). The project covers data preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification techniques.

## About the Project

Email spam detection is a common natural language processing (NLP) task. This notebook applies various text preprocessing techniques and builds a classification model using machine learning to distinguish spam emails from non-spam ones.

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries are used in the project:

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **numpy**: To handle numerical operations efficiently.
- **sklearn (scikit-learn)**: Provides tools for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)**: For text preprocessing, including stopword removal.

## How the Code Works

1. **Data Loading**
   - The dataset containing email content and their corresponding labels (spam or non-spam) is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
   - Text is converted to lowercase.
   - Non-alphanumeric characters and punctuations are removed.
   - URLs, email addresses, and non-ASCII characters are stripped.
   - Stopwords are removed using `nltk`.

3. **Feature Extraction**
   - Converts email text into numerical vectors using `TfidfVectorizer`.

4. **Model Training**
   - A machine learning model (e.g., Multinomial Naive Bayes) is trained to classify the emails.

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - The trained model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository and open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

2. Install the required libraries by running:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk
   ```

3. Run the cells in the notebook step by step. Ensure the dataset is available and loaded correctly.

4. Preprocess the data and train the model. You can modify the preprocessing steps or try different models as needed.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for other classifiers, such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), or Logistic Regression.
- Use advanced NLP techniques like word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) or deep learning models (RNNs, Transformers).
- Implement a web or desktop interface for easier usability.
