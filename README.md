# Spam Email Classifier

This project demonstrates a **Spam Email Classifier** built using machine learning techniques. The notebook preprocesses email text data, extracts meaningful features, and trains a model to classify emails as spam or non-spam (ham). This classifier is a practical application of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning in filtering unwanted messages.

## Overview

Email spam detection is an essential task in modern communication systems, helping to prevent phishing attacks and reduce clutter in email inboxes. This project showcases a complete pipeline for spam email classification, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training. The classifier uses a supervised learning approach to differentiate between spam and legitimate emails based on their content. It aims to provide a clear and modular framework for building and improving email spam classifiers.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Eliminates noise from email content, ensuring high-quality input for the model.
- **Feature Extraction**: Utilizes Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to transform text into meaningful numerical representations.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Implements the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm, well-suited for text classification tasks.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates the model with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to provide a comprehensive understanding of its effectiveness.
- **Customizable Pipeline**: Modular design allows easy adaptation and experimentation with different datasets and models.

## Libraries Used

The following libraries play a vital role in the development of this project:

- **pandas**: For data loading, manipulation, and analysis. It simplifies handling structured datasets.
- **numpy**: Enables efficient numerical computations, crucial for preprocessing and model operations.
- **nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)**: A powerful library for natural language processing, used for tokenization, stopword removal, and text normalization.
- **scikit-learn**: Provides tools for machine learning algorithms, feature extraction, and evaluation metrics.
- **re (Regular Expressions)**: Used extensively for cleaning text data, including removing unwanted characters and patterns.

## Code Workflow

### 1. Data Loading
- Loads email data into a DataFrame with two primary columns:
  - **Message**: The content of the email.
  - **Category**: Labels indicating whether the email is spam (1) or ham (0).

### 2. Text Preprocessing
- **Lowercasing**: Converts all text to lowercase to maintain uniformity.
- **Removing Noise**: Eliminates special characters, punctuation, URLs, email addresses, and non-ASCII characters.
- **Stopword Removal**: Filters out common words (e.g., "the," "and") that do not contribute significantly to classification.
- **Whitespace Normalization**: Ensures consistent spacing by removing extra spaces and line breaks.

### 3. Feature Extraction
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts textual data into numerical format, emphasizing the importance of rare words.

### 4. Model Training
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)**: Trains the classifier on the processed data. This algorithm is computationally efficient and particularly effective for text data.

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Uses metrics such as:
  - **Accuracy**: Proportion of correctly classified emails.
  - **Precision**: Accuracy of spam predictions.
  - **Recall**: Ability to identify all spam emails.
  - **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

## Implementation Details

- **Preprocessing Functions**: Modularized code to handle each preprocessing step efficiently.
- **Pipeline**: Combines preprocessing, feature extraction, and modeling into a streamlined process.
- **Reproducibility**: Clear structure and comments ensure the code is understandable and replicable.
